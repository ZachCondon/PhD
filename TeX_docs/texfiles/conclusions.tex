\chapter{Conclusions}\label{chap_conc}

This is your final chapter. 
It does not have to be titled ``Conclusions"; it could be ``Discussion", or whatever else you prefer.

I am going to use this chapter to talk about references.
All your references should be in the references.bib file, in the same folder as this source file.
Only entries that are actually referenced in the text will show up, so you do not have to delete entries from the references.bib file.
References will appear in the order they are cited in the text.
You can look at the references.bib file to see how to enter each of the references in the following examples.

For papers in proceedings you need: authors' names, title of paper, title of proceedings, location [city, state (if in the US), or city, country (if abroad)], dates (month, days, year).
See examples in \cite{proc1,proc2,proc3}.

For papers in journals you need: authors' names, title of paper, full name of journal, volume, number (if exists), pages, year.
See examples in \cite{artic1,artic2,artic3}.

For book chapters or papers in books you need: authors' names, title of chapter or paper, title of book, name of editors, name of publisher, pages, year.
See examples in \cite{chapter1,chapter2,chapter3}.

For books you need: authors' names, title of book, name of publisher, year.
See examples in \cite{book1,book2,book3}.
