*****Notes for PNS model run generated at 2022-08-30_1358*****. 

    Number of energy bins: 84. 
    Source informationSource 2: Spherical shell encompassing detector, emitting inward.

    NOTE: In case the run times out, the file *_cont.bash will continue the run.

This is a run with a spherical shell at an nps of 1e10. 
I will be comparing this to the run like Paige's at the same nps.
