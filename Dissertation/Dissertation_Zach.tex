% UNOFFICIAL OHIO STATE COLLEGE OF
% ENGINEERING MS/PHD/CANDIDACY TEMPLATE
%************************************************
%************************************************
% Template by Richard Vasques
% Last updated December 2019
%************************************************
%************************************************

% This is a template for my current and future students that will be writing their documents in LaTeX.
% This is an adaptation of the template by Swarnendu Biswas that can be found at https://github.com/swarnendubiswas/ohio-state-coe-dissertation-template.
% This template attempts to follow the rules prescribed by the Graduate School and College of Engineering, and is (hopefully) up to date with the graduate school requirements as of December 2019. 
% This adaptation is intended for students in my research group only, and is not officially supported by The Ohio State University, with no claims being made about its conformity with the current requirements.
% (In fact, this is a hastily put together template, as I do not have the time I
% wish to go deeply into the sty and cls files to make something nicer)

%************************************************
%************************************************

% This file (Dissertation-template) is the source file; that means, the one you need to compile.
% I recommend you name this file after yourself (e.g. Lastname_Dissertation.tex).

%************************************************
%************************************************

% Have the following files in the same folder:
%
% osudissert96-mods.sty
% osudissert96.cls
% This_File.tex (this current file, currently named Dissertation-template.tex, hopefully renamed by you)
% references.bib (this is your bibliography)

%************************************************
%************************************************
% Also, have the subfolders ``texfiles" and ``images".
% In ``images" you will place all figures and images.
% In ``texfiles" you will place all other tex files (duh) of your document,
% including for this template:
% preamble.tex 
% abstract.tex
% acknowl.tex
% vita.tex
% symbols.tex
% introduction.tex
% chapter2.tex
% conclusions.tex
% app1.tex
% and any other tex files you need 

%************************************************
%************************************************

% To change the dissertation to a Master's Thesis, use a documentclass option such as [masters] or [ms].
% To change to a PhD candidacy proposal, use a documentclass option [candidacy].
% The default option is phd.
% Also available are [osudraft] and [twoside].
% As a reminder, documentclass options are a comma-separated list, e.g. \documentclass[ms,osudraft]{osudissert96}

%\documentclass[ms]{osudissert96}
%\documentclass[candidacy]{osudissert96}
\documentclass{osudissert96}

%************************************************
%************************************************

% Put all package definitions in the file Preamble.tex:
\input{texfiles/preamble}
% I have populated the file Preamble.tex with the packages you will
% probably need.
% Feel free to add/change/remove packages according to your needs, as long
% as it works without breaking anything else. 

%************************************************
%************************************************

% It is better to break up the dissertation into multiple files (e.g.,
% one file per chapter, as well as separate files for the abstract,
% acknowledgments, vita, etc.).  These files are brought into the
% document using \include{} statements.  There will be times, however,
% when you don't want to print the ENTIRE dissertation.  You can limit
% what will actually be printed by using the \includeonly{} statement.
% This contains a list of the files you want printed.  Any file NOT
% listed will not be printed.  However, all page numbers, references,
% etc., will be preserved as though all the files were actually
% printed. For example, the line below would result only in chapters 
% "introduction" and "chapter2" being printed (if it were uncommented).

% \includeonly{introduction,chapter2}

%************************************************
%************************************************

% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
% In the newest format, titles should be title case everywhere.
\renewcommand\typesetChapterTitle[1]{#1}

\begin{document}

% First, declare the parts of your title page

%Your full name
\author{Firstname Midname Lastname}

%Title of your work
\title{Ohio State College of Engineering MS/PhD/Candidacy Dissertation Template}

% Your Degrees thus far, not including the one for this document. Ex: B.S., B.Sc., B.E., M.Sc., M.S., etc.
\authordegrees{B.S., M.S.}  

%Program name (TeX will add the words "Graduate Program in"
\unit{Nuclear Engineering}

% Committee members
\advisorname{Richard Vasques} %This should probably be me
\member{Someone 1, Co-Advisor} % Only use Co-Advisor if needed; otherwise just enter the name of the committee member. 
\member{Someone 2}
\member{Maybe Someone 3}

% The following creates the title page
\maketitle

%************************************************
%************************************************

% Next, EITHER a copyright or BLANK page.
%
%   The following creates a page used to copyright your dissertation
%
%   BACKGROUND: Even without this copyright page, your dissertation will
%               carry a common-law copyright. However, if your
%               dissertation ends up seeing wide distribution, your
%               common-law copyright is at risk of being expunged.
%               Adding this copyright page prevents that from happening.
%
%               There are NO DOWNSIDES to including a copyright page as
%               your document is automatically copyright by law anyway.
%               However, this copyright page is OPTIONAL. If you get rid
%               of it, uncomment the \blankpage that follows it so that
%               there is a blank page here. The graduate school requires
%               a page here that is either blank or carries the
%               copyright.
%
%   IMPORTANT NOTE: The graduate school requires either a copyright page
%                   here or a BLANK PAGE here. If you get rid of the
%                   copyright, uncomment the \blankpage that follows it.
%                   You should NOT have BOTH uncommented.
%

% If you get rid of \disscopyright, restore the \blankpage line after it
\disscopyright{}
%\blankpage

%************************************************
%************************************************

% Bring in abstract from separate file named ``abstract.tex''
 \begin{abstract}
	 \input{texfiles/abstract}
 \end{abstract}

%************************************************
%************************************************

%  Dedication goes after the abstract. Dedication is not needed (up to you), and
%should not be present in candidacy proposal. Refrain from adding a dedication
%page until after the defense.
\dedication{\emph{Dedicated to elevators for always lifting people up and being helpful on so many levels.}}

%************************************************
%************************************************

% UPDATED TEXT (2010):
%  The graduate school does not require an external abstract. If this
%  changes, follow the old instructions below.
%
% HISTORICAL TEXT (1996):
%  Uncomment the three lines below to generate the external abstract.  Two
%  copies of this must be turned in to the graduate school.  These lines can
%  be placed pretty much anywhere, since the page numbering should be
%  independent of the rest of the thesis
%

% \begin{externalabstract}
%   \input{abstract}
% \end{externalabstract}

%************************************************
%************************************************

% If this is a PhD or MS document, include the following:
% Bring in Acknowledgment from separate file named ``acknowl.tex'' or some other name you defined
\include{texfiles/acknowl} % Do not include for a candidacy proposal, and 
%refrain from including it until after the defense.

%************************************************
%************************************************

% Bring in Vita from separate file named ``vita.tex'' or some other name you defined
\include{texfiles/vita} % Do not include for a candidacy proposal

%************************************************

% Make the Table of Contents and lists
\tableofcontents %Table of contents
\listoftables %List of tables (automatic)
\listoffigures %List of figures (automatic)

	 % symbols.tex)

    % If you have appendices in your dissertation, you will need the
    % following, else keep it commented. The following appendices should be in
    % files called ``app1.tex'' and ``app2.tex'', and they
    % look just like any chapter. You may rename it as you want.
